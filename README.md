# Search Engine Algorithm
A simple algorithm in Java to search for numbers in an Array.

This is a simple Java program that performs a linear search in an array of integers. Linear search is a basic search method, where each element of the array is checked sequentially until the desired element is found or the entire array is traversed.

The code starts by defining an array of integers called "array" and asks the user to enter a number to search for in the database. It then uses the linear search function to find the position of the number in the array.

The searchLinear method goes through the array and compares each element with the target number. If the element is found, the position is stored in the position variable. After traversing the entire array, the function returns the position of the element or -1 if the element was not found.

The result of the search is then displayed on the console, indicating whether the element was found and, if so, in which position.

The program is in the "src" folder, with the name "Main.java".
